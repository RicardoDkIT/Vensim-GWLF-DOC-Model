	~	kg/day
	~	This is proportion of the available DOC that is transfered to a pool that can supply \

		pool for two reasons 1) the amount is reduced by the first term in the \
		equation to account for the fact that not all watershed lands produce DOC \
		and 2) it is reduced by the second term since omly a small protion of the \
		total soil water column is assumed to contribute to runoff DOC losses.
		
		The parameter surface soil depth can be optimized to increase or decrease the \
		importance of surface runoff DOC contributions.
		
		Im not totally satisified with this method of seperating surface and sub \
		surface DOC losses.  It would seem more logical the the the surface losses \
		would come from the unsat zone.  However, the hydro model divides \
		rain/melt into surface and sub-surface components (surface runoff is not \

		The original hydro model equation was (MAX ( (Deep Satzone + deep percolation) * \

		Storage and the potential withdrawal from the sat zone that day as defined \
		by Sat Deficit.If there is not enough water to meet this demand no other \
		calculations occur and deep percolation is 0. The second embeded IF is \
		used when there is enought water to support deep percolation Then the same \
		equation as in the original hydrology model is.  If the water (above the \
		Min Sat Zone Storage) is greater than the Deep Sat Deficit then the Deep \
		Sat Deficit is removed. Otherwise, all water up to the Min Sat Zone \
