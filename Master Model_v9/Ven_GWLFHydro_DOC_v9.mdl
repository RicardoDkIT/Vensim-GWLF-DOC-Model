	~	kg/day
	~	This is proportion of the available DOC that is transfered to a pool that can supply \

		pool for two reasons 1) the amount is reduced by the first term in the \
		equation to account for the fact that not all watershed lands produce DOC \
		and 2) it is reduced by the second term since omly a small protion of the \
		total soil water column is assumed to contribute to runoff DOC losses.
		
		The parameter surface soil depth can be optimized to increase or decrease the \
		importance of surface runoff DOC contributions.
		
		Im not totally satisified with this method of seperating surface and sub \
		surface DOC losses.  It would seem more logical the the the surface losses \
		would come from the unsat zone.  However, the hydro model divides \
		rain/melt into surface and sub-surface components (surface runoff is not \
