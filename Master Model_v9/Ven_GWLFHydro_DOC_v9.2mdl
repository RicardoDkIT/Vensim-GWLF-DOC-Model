		The parameter surface soil depth can be optimized to increase or decrease the \

		Im not totally satisified with this method of seperating surface and sub \

		would come from the unsat zone.  However, the hydro model divides \

So before optimizing, just run the model and get the mean value and update the equation. That value will not change after the optimization - it comes from measured data

The mean in the equation below has to be updated MANUALLY after a first simulation but before optimization

So before optimizing, just run the model and get the mean value and update the equation. That value will not change after the optimization - it comes from measured data
