Now have added two new lu subgroups
   lu DOC dryland - these are the lu categories that could be expected to mainly contribute
				    DOC by sub surface pathways.  mainly forest and grassland s
					
   lu DOc wetland - these are the lu categories that are wet standing or saturated soils
			         wetland bogs and marsh.  It is expected that these are not contributing
					 to sub surface DOC, but are contributing through direct runoff and runoff
					 delayed as channel flow.  Decomposition into wetlands is only temperature
					 dependent and is greater that in the dryland soils.
					 
I have eliminated using the ratio of surface soil storage to total water column storage since
The SWC can be quite different from catchment to catchment.  For dry lands there is now just a 
fixed ratio between DOC loss from surface and subsurface processes that can be calibrated

The annual loss of DOC g m2 y-1 is now calculated for both the wetland and dryland lu 
categories.  Dryland is presently at about 3-4 g m2 y-1 based on the lase v8 calibration the wetland
is now set at about 20-30 g m2 y-1 based on the map from the AGU presentation.

  I cannot think of a way to avoid this.  I considered using the
ratio of runoff/max runoff, but then the C store will never be drawn down to 0.  However the 
effects of previous storms should prevail since they will draw down the store and what remains 
will be drawn down next time.

Loss of DOC from surface runoff is still dependent on a presumed storage of DOC in either the 
upper soil layer or the wetland. The loss of stored surface DOC is based on the potential 
contributing area which is defined by the ratio of runoff volume/rain melt depth. Quick check 
suggests that the contributing area will only occasionally exceed the total land area so the 
store will not be emptied at every storm.  Also this avoids the need for the surface soil 
depth parpameter that was in model V8.  It seems better since it is based on actual physical lu 
areas and no additional parameters are required

I now fixed two equations that caused a divide by zero error when the wetland lu was 0 
See the excel sheet for more detail. The two equations were for the variables C loss Wetland Soils
