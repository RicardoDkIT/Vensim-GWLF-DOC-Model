Now have added two new lu subgroups
   lu DOC dryland - these are the lu categories that could be expected to mainly contribute
				    DOC by sub surface pathways.  mainly forest and grassland s
					
   lu DOc wetland - these are the lu categories that are wet standing or saturated soils
			         wetland bogs and marsh.  It is expected that these are not contributing
					 to sub surface DOC, but are contributing through direct runoff and runoff
					 delayed as channel flow.  Decomposition into wetlands is only temperature
					 dependent and is greater that in the dryland soils.
					 
I have eliminated using the ratio of surface soil storage to total water column storage since
The SWC can be quite different from catchment to catchment.  For dry lands there is now just a 
fixed ratio between DOC loss from surface and subsurface processes that can be calibrated

The annual loss of DOC g m2 y-1 is now calculated for both the wetland and dryland lu 
categories.  Dryland is presently at about 3-4 g m2 y-1 based on the lase v8 calibration the wetland
is now set at about 20-30 g m2 y-1 based on the map from the AGU presentation.

I cannot think of a way to avoid this.  I considered using the
ratio of runoff/max runoff, but then the C store will never be drawn down to 0.  However the 
effects of previous storms should prevail since they will draw down the store and what remains 
will be drawn down next time.

Loss of DOC from surface runoff is still dependent on a presumed storage of DOC in either the 
upper soil layer or the wetland. The loss of stored surface DOC is based on the potential 
contributing area which is defined by the ratio of runoff volume/rain melt depth. Quick check 
suggests that the contributing area will only occasionally exceed the total land area so the 
store will not be emptied at every storm.  Also this avoids the need for the surface soil 
depth parpameter that was in model V8.  It seems better since it is based on actual physical lu 
areas and no additional parameters are required

I now fixed two equations that caused a divide by zero error when the wetland lu was 0 
See the excel sheet for more detail. The two equations were for the variables C loss Wetland Soils
and Areal Yearly Mean Total Wetland C

Clean up and DOC model 2 diagram a bit (still more to do) by removing unused variables and 
I also calculated the Unsat Sat and Deep Sat C storage normalized to area (g/m2)

2024-02-09 Don
Improved some comments added a few new variables to server as payoff in DOC calibrations

2024-02-09 Ricardo
1.On the Optimizing view - Point Meas DOC variable was added, this is equal to Meas DOC but gets rid of "0" measurements of DOC in case they are in the input DOC dataset
2.On the DOC 2 view - C loss surface corr was added. This correction factor has influence on both C loss Wetland Soils and C loss Surface Soils
3.On the DOC 2 view - Total C loss Surface Runoff equation was modified, from: C loss Surface Soils+C loss Wetland Soils, to: (C loss Surface Soils+C loss Wetland Soils)*MIN(runoff lu DOC, SAT CAP)
4 On the DOC 2 view - DOC Channel Coeff was added. This to have an independent coefficient regulatin the C loss Channel flow.

I made a small change to the hydrology model so like the sat zone the deep sat zone always
retains a minimal amount of water (presently 1cm).  This was done to prevent unrealistic concentration 
spikes in DOC concentration.  Also some additional variables added to the calibration view.

2024-02-23 Don
Improved the organization and commenting of DOC variables on the optimization view.  Added 
agricultural land use to DOC lu and also to Dryland DOC lu

Fixed error in calculation of wetland and dryland runoff (from slack below)
	 I have discovered an error in the surface runoff portion of the V9 model.  It has to do with
	 the calculation of runoff DOC dryland Soils m3 or similarly runoff DOC wetland Soils.
	 
	 As an example for the dryland case the original equation was
	 
		SUM(runoff lu[lu DOC dryland!])*Area DOC dryland Soils*10000
		
	Where what I now believe the correct equation should be	
	
		SUM(runoff lu[lu DOC dryland!]*AREA LU[lu DOC dryland!])/ SUM ( AREA LU[lu DOC dryland!] )*Area DOC dryland Soils*10000
		
		
	
	The difference is that in the second equation the runoff from each landuse (cm) is not just summed but a area weighted mean 
	value is calculated.  Then the final part of the equation (*Area DOC dryland Soils*10000) converts cm/day 
	to m3/day.  It is also confusing with the units since AREA LU is in ha, but Area DOC dryland Soils is 
	converted to km2 
	
Also made the wetland and dryland contributing areas explicit variabled to allow better visualization.
Added the possibility of basing the proportion of available DOC lost from dryland surface runoff based
on loss ratios from the hydrologic model.

Some additions calculations of the optimization view.  Some cleaning and rearranging but core model should not have
Changed

2024-03-27 Don
Change was made to the the calculations of fast and slow gw flow.  There was an error related
to the addtion of a min storage value.  Flow was set to 0 when the zone level was less that the
minimal storage, and normally calculated otherwise.  This meand that fast gw is the storage * the
recession coeff.  This is wrong at small storage levels since the flow would be based on the total
storage in the zone and results in a larger than expected spike flow.  The correct equation should
be (storage-minimal storage) * the recession coeff  This remove only the excess water from the 
zone storage.

Also added calculation of Avaliable C in surface dryland and wetland soils in g/m2 

2024-03-30
Added a few new optimisation variables to the hydrologic model that will allow the sat zone 
initial water levels to be set to the max (Unsat and deep sat) or mean (sat) level of the 
simulation step

2024-04-04
changed the calculation of Available C Surface dryland soils gm2 and Available C Surface wetland soils gm2
to use ZIDZ to avoid crash when one of these land uses (usally wetlands) are zero.  Similarly also Cahanged
to ZIDZ in the calculation of runoff DOC wetland Soils m3 and runoff DOC dryland Soils m3.
